  title: Nuxt.js - Why? How? Oh yeah!
  keynote: false
  extract: >
    Nuxt.js - You probably have heard the name of the Vue.js framework at least once.
    Maybe when a fellow colleague gave it a try, or when you saw it on the GitHub report as 4th fastest growing open
    source project in 2018.
    But as a smart developer, you're skeptical: Why would I need another framework that even sits on top
    of *another* one? What is this SSR everyone is talking about? What problems would Nuxt solve for me and how to
    get started?
    During my talk, all these questions (and many more) will be answered.
    Join an introduction to Nuxt.js and experience it with no previous knowledge needed besides Vue.

  title: Getting started with nuxt.js + static sites
  keynote: false
  extract: >
    Did you know nuxt.js can pre render all your pages so you can easily create static sites using the Vue.js framework.
    That means you have a Single Page Application without the need of a server and with great SEO and that's just a few
    of the benefits of using nuxt.js. In this talk I will take you through how I setup nuxt with all the extras I
    normally add to create a great boilerplate project configured to my liking. I will also show you how easy it is to
    generate static pages, create pre commit hooks and deploy.

  title: Vuex Modules in practice
  keynote: false
  extract: >
    When building complex applications the management of the single state tree can be very tricky and difficult to
    maintain.
    The use of Vuex Modules will help you to keep your code concise and have a clear separation of the application's
    state facilitating the maintainability and organisation of the code.

  title: A taste of hardware connectivity on the web with Vue
  keynote: false
  extract: >
    The browsers can actually take control of physical devices in the real world like lightbulbs, robots and even drones
    by providing new web standard hardware connectivity APIs such as WebBluetooth, WebUSB, NFC and etc.
    On the other hand, Progressive web apps opens a new era to build a web application that works offline and resemble a
    native application. Hence, everyday we are getting closer to run a web app only on browsers that doesn't need to be
    install from any app store and it will take control of hardwares around us.
    In this session, I am going through some of the web capabilities to connect devices into a progressive web app which
    has been build but Vue.js and show how web could go beyond the browsers and take control of our devices around us.
